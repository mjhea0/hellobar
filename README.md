# Hello Bar

Just a simple notification bar, similar to [Hello Bar](https://www.hellobar.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Fork/Clone
1. Update the `content` object in *hello.js*
1. Update the media query in *hello.css*, if you want the bar to be displayed on mobile devices
1. Add both *hello.css* and *hello.js* into your project

> If you decide to send the button click info to Google Analytics, then the "JavaScript tracking snippet" must be already set up on your site. See
